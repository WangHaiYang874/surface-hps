classdef leaf < surfaceop.patch
%SURFACEOP.LEAF   Leaf subclass of a patch (where subproblems are solved).
%   P = SURFACEOP.LEAF(DOMAIN, S, D2N, EDGES, AINV) creates a LEAF object
%   P and assigns each of the inputs to their associated properties in P.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DEVELOPER NOTES:
% * Note: We assume that a LEAF has four sides and that its boundary nodes
%   XYZ are stored in the order "left", "right", "down", "up".

    properties

        n        % Discretization size of patch.
        Ainv     % Local (homogeneous BC) solution operator.
        normal_d % Normal derivative operator.
                 % (These are stored so the RHS can be efficiently updated)
